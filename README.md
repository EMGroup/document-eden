This is a quick demo of how to run JS-Eden code within a webpage.

## Cloning the repository

This repository uses the main JS-Eden repository as a submodule - to clone this repository as well as the submodule, run:

`git clone --recurse-submodules [repository-path]`


## Running

To get started, run this folder in a webserver. For instance, to use a basic Python webserver you can do:

`python3 -m http.server`

This should give output like this:

`Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ...`

Then you can view the main page by going to http://localhost:8000/demo.html (change port according to the above line)
